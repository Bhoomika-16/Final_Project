# Final_Project
 
The usage of credit card has increased drastically and credit card fraud and the loss to credit 
card users also have increased. Supervised learning has been widely used to detect 
anomalies in credit card transaction records based on the assumption that the pattern of 
fraud would depend on past transactions. However, unsupervised learning does not ignore 
the fact that fraudsters change their approaches based on customersâ€™ behaviors and patterns. 
Our aim is to develop an automatic, efficient classifier for anomaly detection that can 
identify fraudulent transactions on credit cards. Autoencoders combined with the Isolation
Forest algorithm are used to attain an accuracy better than the accuracy obtained with 
Autoencoders alone. The dataset used for training the model is obtained from Kaggle.
